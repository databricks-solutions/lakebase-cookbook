# GraphRAG on Lakebase

Knowledge-graph-augmented RAG served entirely from **Lakebase** (managed Postgres). Classic RAG
retrieves text chunks by vector similarity and misses *relationships* ("which suppliers cover the
products whose demand is surging, and what substitutes share those suppliers?"). GraphRAG adds a
knowledge graph so retrieval can **traverse relationships**, not just match text.

## How it works

- **Graph store** — `nodes` + `edges` relational tables (typed, JSONB props).
- **Traversal** — a **recursive CTE** walks edges out from a seed, bounded by `max_hops`.
- **Semantic seed** — **pgvector** HNSW (cosine) finds the entry nodes for a question.
- **Hybrid retrieval** — seed with vectors, expand along the graph, rank by a blended
  `seed_similarity × 0.5^hop` score. See [`sql/graphrag_retrieval.sql`](sql/graphrag_retrieval.sql).

A generic Databricks **model-serving** endpoint supplies embeddings and answer synthesis — swap in
whichever provider your workspace has registered. Nothing here is cloud-specific.

## Honest capability note

Lakebase is managed Postgres — there is **no native property-graph engine** (no Apache AGE, no
Cypher). This example builds GraphRAG on relational + vector primitives, all verified as supported
Lakebase extensions:

| Need | How | Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph store | `nodes` / `edges` tables | core |
| Multi-hop traversal | recursive CTE (`WITH RECURSIVE`) | core |
| Hierarchies | `ltree` paths | `ltree` |
| Semantic seed | pgvector HNSW, cosine (`<=>`) | `vector` |
| Fuzzy entity link | trigram similarity | `pg_trgm` |

Position it as *"graph traversal via recursive CTEs + semantic retrieval via pgvector"* — great for
bounded k-hop operational retrieval; **not** a billion-edge graph-analytics engine.

## Building the graph from documents (upstream indexing)

`graph_build.py` starts from *structured* dims. If your source is documents, `graph_upstream.py`
covers the phase before that:

```
parse (ai_parse_document) -> chunk -> extract (ai_query, constrained schema)
  -> entity resolution (trigram + union-find) -> gold_triplets
```

Chunking, entity resolution and triplet assembly are pure Python and covered by the offline smoke
test. The two steps that need a workspace — parse and extract — are in
[`sql/upstream_ai_functions.sql`](sql/upstream_ai_functions.sql).

Two things matter more than the rest, both learned from running this live:

- **Entity resolution is the load-bearing step.** The same entity appears written many ways
  ("Acme", "Acme Foods", "ACME Foods Inc."), and each spelling would otherwise become its own
  node — fragmenting the graph exactly where multi-hop retrieval needs it joined. Note that
  Jaccard trigram similarity alone is *not* enough: "Acme Foods" vs "Acme Foods Incorporated"
  scores only `0.42`, so legal suffixes and abbreviations slip past it. `resolve_entities()` also
  applies a containment measure (the shape of `pg_trgm`'s `word_similarity()`), which scores that
  pair `0.92`. Merges are written back as `SAME_AS` edges so the decision is auditable in the
  graph rather than lost in the pipeline.
- **Pin the relation vocabulary.** Constraining entity types is not enough. Left free, the model
  invents a predicate per sentence — a live run over two short documents produced
  `SUPPLIES_TO_RETAILERS_ACROSS`, `OPERATES_DISTRIBUTION_CENTER_IN`, `IS_LOCATED_IN` and
  `BELONGS_TO_CATEGORY`, the last two near-misses for this schema's `LOCATED_IN` and
  `BELONGS_TO`. Every spelling becomes its own edge label and the typed-path logic in the
  retrieval SQL degrades toward an untyped walk. Constrain the predicate list in the prompt, and
  pass `allowed_predicates=DEFAULT_PREDICATES, on_unknown="drop"` as a backstop.

Two AI-Functions details the SQL had wrong until it was run against a live workspace, both now
fixed and commented in place:

- **`ai_parse_document` has no `document.text` field.** It returns schema v2.0, whose text lives
  in `document.elements[].content` with a `type` per element. Reading `parsed:document.text`
  yields NULL and the pipeline silently produces nothing — concatenate the text elements instead.
- **`ai_query`'s DDL-string `responseFormat` rejects a top-level array.** Use the JSON-schema form
  to constrain the model and `from_json` to type the result. The SQL carries the exact error you
  get otherwise.

## Operational guardrails

Defaults that keep retrieval fast, precise, and cost-predictable on real Lakebase:

- **Bound `max_hops` to 2 on dense graphs.** Recursive-CTE cost is *density-driven*: at 4 hops on a
  dense graph the walk approaches a full-graph scan, while 2 hops stays bounded. Raise hops only on
  sparse graphs. (Indicative scale figures — tens of ms at 2 hops on ~1M nodes / 10M edges, seconds
  at 4 hops — come from a separate benchmark of this pattern, not from this repo's smoke test.)
- **Set a `seed_floor` under distractor-heavy corpora.** Weak semantic seeds drag unrelated subgraphs
  into the ranking and dilute precision; a cosine floor drops them. **Calibrate the floor to
  your embedding model's actual similarity distribution** — it is not a portable constant.
  Measured on live Lakebase with `databricks-gte-large-en`, this example graph's node
  similarities span only `0.38`-`0.71`, so a `0.3` floor changes nothing while `0.555` drops
  every distractor and keeps every on-topic node (the on-topic supplier below the floor still
  arrives via graph expansion). Cosine ranges
  `[-1, 1]`, so `-1.0` keeps all seeds (identical to no floor). **`:seed_floor` is a required
  bind** — Postgres has no server-side default for a named parameter, so existing callers of the
  SQL must pass it even to keep the old behavior (bind `-1.0`); omitting it raises
  `bind message supplies 2 parameters, but prepared statement requires 3`. The Python twin
  defaults it to `-1.0`, so Python callers need no change. **Watch the empty-seed case:** a floor
  above every node's similarity empties the seed CTE and the query returns *zero* rows — detect
  that in your caller and either retry at `-1.0` or decline to answer, rather than synthesizing
  from no context. See `:seed_floor` in
  [`sql/graphrag_retrieval.sql`](sql/graphrag_retrieval.sql).
- **Keep a minimum Lakebase compute above zero for latency-sensitive serving.** After scale-to-zero,
  the first query pays a cold-start penalty of several× the warm latency while index pages load in
  (measured on a live instance at ~6× on a small graph; scale-dependent).
- **Seed with plain pgvector, not a BM25+vector hybrid.** Lexical fusion adds latency and can *hurt*
  ranking on this workload — the relationship recall comes from graph expansion, not lexical overlap.
- **Treat the HNSW build as a one-time cost that scales with corpus size** (indicatively seconds at
  10⁴ nodes, minutes at 10⁵), independent of query latency. Storing embeddings as `halfvec` (fp16)
  cuts the embedding-plus-HNSW-index storage ~2.5× vs fp32 (measured) at negligible recall cost — a
  cheap lever for large graphs. It is **not** a drop-in edit of `schema.sql`: `vector_cosine_ops`
  rejects `halfvec`, so switching the column type also requires `halfvec_cosine_ops` on the index
  (or an expression index `((embedding::halfvec(1024)) halfvec_cosine_ops)`) *and* a matching
  `::halfvec` cast on the bound query vector, or the `<=>` lookup fails with a missing-operator
  error.
- **Route simple, single-entity questions to the managed path first.** If a question needs no
  multi-hop traversal, ontology-enriched Genie or a plain vector lookup is cheaper; reserve GraphRAG
  for genuinely relational / multi-hop queries.

## Cross-stack interop (`gold_triplets`)

The `nodes` / `edges` tables map to a portable **8-column triplet shape** — `subject_id, subject_type,
predicate, object_id, object_type, confidence, source_method, source_agent` — so the same graph can be
emitted or consumed by other graph stacks (Spark/Python builders, other engines) **without migration**.
Undirected relations (`SUBSTITUTE_FOR`) are stored once with sorted endpoints and made bidirectional
at query time by the retrieval SQL, so the view emits **both directions** for them — a directed
consumer would otherwise miss the reverse. De-duplicate symmetric predicates on ingest.
It's a column contract, not a dependency. See [`sql/gold_triplets_mapping.sql`](sql/gold_triplets_mapping.sql).

## Run the offline smoke test

Validates the retrieval + build logic with no Lakebase, no model endpoint:

```bash
cd agents/graphrag
uv run --python 3.11 --with duckdb --with numpy smoketest/graphrag_logic_smoketest.py
```

67 assertions: semantic seed, graph expansion surfacing connected context flat RAG misses,
dangling-edge guard, blended-score ranking, depth bound, and the `seed_floor` distractor guard.

## Deploy (Asset Bundle)

```bash
cd agents/graphrag
# set your Lakebase database path + endpoints, then:
databricks bundle deploy -t dev \
  --var lakebase_database="projects/<id>/branches/production/databases/<db>"
databricks bundle run graphrag_build -t dev
```

The bundle deploys `notebooks/graphrag_build_and_query.py` as a job. The notebook assembles a
small example supply-chain graph and embeds its nodes via your embedding endpoint out of the box.
