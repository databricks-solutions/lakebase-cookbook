"""Upstream indexing: raw document text -> gold_triplets rows.

`graph_build.py` assembles a graph from *structured* dims plus LLM enrichment. This module
covers the phase before that — turning unstructured documents into the same graph shape:

    parse -> chunk -> extract (typed triples) -> entity resolution -> gold_triplets

Parse and extract are the two steps that need a workspace: `ai_parse_document` for files in a
Volume and `ai_query` with a response schema for typed extraction. Both live in
`sql/upstream_ai_functions.sql`. Everything here is pure Python — chunking, trigram entity
resolution and triplet assembly — with extraction behind an `Extractor` protocol so the offline
smoke test drives it deterministically with no infra.

Entity resolution is the part that matters most in practice: the same entity is written many
ways across documents ("Acme", "Acme Foods", "ACME Foods Inc.") and each spelling would
otherwise become its own node, fragmenting the graph exactly where multi-hop retrieval needs it
joined. We block candidates by character-trigram similarity and merge with union-find, mirroring
`pg_trgm` from the serve layer up into the build.

Output lands in the 8-column `gold_triplets` contract (see `sql/gold_triplets_mapping.sql`), so
embeddings and Lakebase sync downstream are unchanged.

    one node. Symmetric predicates get sorted endpoints (see SYMMETRIC_PREDICATES).

    `source_method` vocabulary: `llm_extract` for an extracted relation, `entity_resolution` for
    a SAME_AS alias edge. The view in sql/gold_triplets_mapping.sql uses `structured` and
