# Lakebase Cookbook

Examples and guides to accelerate your **Databricks Lakebase** projects.

Lakebase is Databricks' fully-managed, Postgres-compatible OLTP database, built
for transactional workloads that sit alongside your lakehouse.

- **Announcement blog:** [databricks.com/product/lakebase](https://www.databricks.com/product/lakebase)
- **Official documentation:** [docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp/)

## Examples in this cookbook

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [GraphRAG](/docs/examples/graphrag/) | Knowledge-graph-augmented RAG with pgvector seeding and recursive-CTE graph traversal |
| [Branching CI/CD](/docs/examples/branching-cicd/) | Validate schema changes on an isolated Lakebase branch in GitHub CI/CD, with an AI impact report per PR |
| [Consort](/docs/examples/consort/) | Spec-first, test-driven agentic development where every green is a real test on a live Lakebase branch, held by a deterministic state machine and human gates |
| [SCM Extension](/docs/examples/lakebase-scm-extension/) | A VS Code / Cursor extension that pairs each code branch with a Lakebase database branch |
| [SCM Utils](/docs/examples/lakebase-scm-utils/) | The portable engine behind the extension and Consort: branching, the paired-branch SCM state machine, credentials, and migrations |
| [AI Memory](/docs/examples/ai-memory/) | Short-term, long-term, and semantic (pgvector) agent memory on one Lakebase store |
| [FastAPI App](/docs/examples/lakebase-fastapi/) | A Databricks App serving a Lakebase synced table through a FastAPI REST API |
| [Genie Caching](/docs/examples/lakebase-genie-caching/) | A pgvector semantic cache in front of Genie Spaces, so reworded questions reuse SQL instead of regenerating it |
| [Feature Store](/docs/examples/feature-store/) | Feature store integration |
| [Reverse ETL](/docs/examples/reverse-etl/) | Reverse ETL patterns |
